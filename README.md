# **CHECKERS**

## Rules and General Overview


BlackJack is a single player game. The goal of the game is to get as close to 21 without going over 21. The player starts with 2 cards and the dealer starts with one. You have the choice to either hit or stand. If you choose to hit, a card will be added to your hand. When you choose to stand, the dealer flips his card. If either the player or the dealer ends up with a score over 21 then that person loses, if not then the person closest to 21 wins the hand.


## Special Conditions
